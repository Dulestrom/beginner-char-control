# Character Controller

Just a basic character controller that I created using Unity's new Input System. Controller is WIP (I'm a beginner).

With this Character Controller, the Character can walk, run, jump, fall, attack, crouch etc.

Need to implement Dashing, and create a State Machine to reduce all code in one place.
